# Self-Assessment

Throuughout this final project, I was the circle role. This means I created the database in pgadmin through AWS and Google Colab. I also assisted in getting the database to link to python so other group members could pull the data from the database, rather than pulling from a csv file. Because I was the circle role, I also created the vizualization in GEOJSON and Tableau. There are two vizualizations because we ran out of time coding in javascritp to have a cohesive final vizualization. For roles I did not take, we as a group worked very well together during and outside of class hours to meet and review code for partners that were struggling with errors. So I assisted in developing clustering groups and K means. The greatest personal challenge to me was simply time management. This was a large final project and we wanted to do a lot with the data we had. Trying to create a javascript and GeoJson file from scratch was very difficult, although ackowledging not undoable, but took a little too much time than we as a group were able to give. 

# Team Assessment 

Our communication protocol was fairly simple, we worked on our own trying to run and code and get our different parts of the poject to work. If there were any issues/ errors we would bring them to our team and review collectively to try and fix the errors that existed. We were also able and willing to meet outside of class hours to ensure we had a good final product to put together. Our biggest strength was communication and working with each other not for each other or talking over one another. All ideas were listened to, shared, and positive feedback was provided. 

# Summary of Project

This project was an analysis of crime data in Austin, Texas specifically for the year 2021 (which we filtered to get) from data.gov. In order to complete this analysis, data was loaded in AWS, managed in pyspark and a database was created in pgadmin. That database then populated the fields for data to be pulled in python and the machine learning models. For machine learning the group did both K means and clustering because we were very interested in predictability of both models. The results of the analysis were being able to quite literally predict crime in Austin, Texas given the time of day, month of year, and census tract.
